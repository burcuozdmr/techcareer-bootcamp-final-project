# EventHarbor 

This project is an event display system that allows users to browse and manage events across different categories such as Music, Art, and Sport. Users can view events, filter them by date, location, and event name, and also access detailed information, like date and time, location, ticket price etc., about each event on its detail page. Additionally, the project includes an admin panel for managing events in the database, allowing for the addition, deletion, and editing of events.

## My process

### Built with

- Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS
- Database: Firebase Database
- Other Libraries: React Router for routing, Bootstrap for styling

### What I learned


1. Firebase Integration
  - Learned how to integrate Firebase into the React application for real-time database communication. This includes setting up a Firebase project, adding Firebase SDK to the project, establishing connection with Firebase database services such as Realtime Database, and accessing data from and writing data to the database.

2. Data Management with Firebase: 
  - Utilized Firebase SDK methods to read and write data to Firebase Realtime Database. This involved fetching data from the database using methods like get or on, and writing data to the database using methods like set, update, or push.

3. React Router Navigation: 
  - Utilized React Router for dynamic navigation within the application, enabling users to seamlessly navigate between different pages based on their interactions and application state.

4. Loader Implementation: 
  - Implemented loading indicators (loaders) using React Router to enhance user experience while fetching data from the Firebase database. This ensures a smoother transition and provides feedback to users during data loading processes.

5. Action Functions Usage: 
  - Leveraged action functions provided by React Router to manage page transitions and manipulate application state based on user interactions. This allowed for seamless page transitions and effective control over application flow.

6. Data Management: 
  - I improved my ability to manage data using state and props in React components. This is important for facilitating data communication between components.

 I completed the project, which we started as a bootcamp final assignment as a group of three people, then continued alone. I made many changes to the initial application and made the website functional. As a result, I have knowledge of every aspect of the project and I have contributed to every aspect of it.
